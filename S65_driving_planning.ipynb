    "of actions available at any moment in time is small and easily computed.\n",

    "motion planning can be reduced to choosing from this set of seven possible actions at each moment in time.\n",

    "$P_2$, $P_3$, or $P_4$.\n",
    "If there is a rapidly approaching oncoming car, it might be best to use $P_2$, to delay changing lanes\n",
    "until that car has passed by.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a motion primitive typically includes a set of conditions that define when\n",
    "the primitive is applicable, and a set of possible transitions to other motion primitives.\n",
    "For example, it would be reasonable to veer left slightly and then drive straight, but it would\n",
    "not be reasonable to transition from forward motion to reverse motion without some intermediate\n",
    "maneuvering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these conditions, planning can be effected by a generate-and-test approach.\n",
